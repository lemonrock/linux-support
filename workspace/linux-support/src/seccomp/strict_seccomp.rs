/// The only system calls that the calling thread is permitted to make are `read()`, `write()`, `_exit()` (but not `exit_group()`), and `sigreturn()`.
///
/// Other system calls result in the delivery of a `SIGKILL` signal.
/// Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications that may need to execute untrusted byte code, perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.
///
/// Note that although the calling thread can no longer call `sigprocmask()`, it can use `sigreturn()` to block all signals apart from `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP`.
/// This means that `alarm()` (for example) is not sufficient for restricting the process's execution time.
/// Instead, to reliably terminate the process, `SIGKILL` must be used.
/// This can be done by using `timer_create()` with `SIGEV_SIGNAL` and `sigev_signo` set to `SIGKILL`, or by using `setrlimit()` to set the hard limit for `RLIMIT_CPU`.
