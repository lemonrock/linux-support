	/// The buffers associated with the iovecs will be locked in memory and charged against the user's `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` resource limit.
	///
	/// See `getrlimit(2)` for more information.
	/// Additionally, there is a size limit of 1GiB per buffer.
	/// Currently, the buffers must be anonymous, non-file-backed memory, such as that returned by `malloc(3)` or `mmap(2)` with the `MAP_ANONYMOUS` flag set.
	/// It is expected that this limitation will be lifted in the future.
	/// Huge pages are supported as well.
	/// Note that the entire huge page will be pinned in the kernel, even if only a portion of it is used.
	/// NOTE: Relies on `iovec` having the same layout as a Rust slice.
	/// `buffers` needs to be anonymous memory from either `mmap()`, `malloc()` or a memory file descriptor.
	/// It lives until unregistered.
	///
	/// After a successful call, the supplied buffers are mapped into the kernel and eligible for I/O.
	/// To make use of them, the application must specify the `IORING_OP_READ_FIXED` or `IORING_OP_WRITE_FIXED` opcodes in the submission queue entry (see the `struct io_uring_sqe` definition in `io_uring_enter(2)`), and set the `buf_index` field to the desired buffer index.
	/// The memory range described by the submission queue entry's `addr` and `len` fields must fall within the indexed buffer.
	///
	/// It is perfectly valid to setup a large buffer and then only use part of it for an I/O, as long as the range is within the originally mapped region.
	///
	/// An application can increase or decrease the size or number of registered buffers by first unregistering the existing buffers, and then issuing a new call to `io_uring_register()` with the new buffers.
	///
	/// Note that registering buffers will wait for the ring to idle.
	/// If the application currently has requests in-flight, the registration will wait for those to finish before proceeding.
