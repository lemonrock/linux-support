/// Linux Security Capabilities.
///
/// These are per-thread and per-file.
///
/// Any thread created inherits the Thread capability sets.
///
/// File capabilities and thread capabilities intertwine in a very complex way, but, in essence, are only of interest if executing third-party programs that need file capabilities (eg `ping`).
///
/// Get bounding sets by parsing `/proc/<pid>/status` (or the equivalent for a thread).
///
/// # File capability sets
///
/// Used when `execve()` is used.
///
///
/// ## Permitted
///
/// * These capabilities are automatically permitted to the thread, regardless of the thread's `Inheritable` set.
/// * Formerly known as `forced`.
///
///
/// ## Inheritable
///
/// * These capabilities are `ANDed` with the thread's `Inheritable` set then this set is `ORed` with the file's `Permitted` set to create the thread's `Permitted` set after `execve()`.
/// * Formerly known as `allowed`.
///
///
/// ## Effective Bit.
///
/// * If set, then any capabilities acquired on `execve()` are added to the `Effective` set.
///
///
/// # Thread capability sets
///
///
/// ## Permitted
///
/// * This is the superset for the effective capabilities that the thread may assume.
/// * This is the superset for the inheritable capabilities that the thread may have *unless* it has the `CAP_SETPCAP` capability in its effective set.
/// * Once a thread drops a capabilities from its permitted set, it can never regain it *unless* it `execve()`s a program with either:-
///		* file capabilities set
/// 	* setuid/setgid bits set.
///
///
/// ## Effective
///
/// * This is the set of capabilities used by the kernel to perform permission checks for the thread.
/// * It is a subset of `Permitted`.
///
///
/// ## Inheritable
///
/// * This is a set of capabilities it is desired to be preserved across an `execve()`.
/// * They are `ANDed` with the file capability's `Inheritable` set then `ORed` with the file capability's `Permitted` set to create the resultant `Permitted` set for a thread after `execve()`.
/// * Ordinarily, non-root programs lose their capabilities on `execve()` unless using `Ambient` capabilities.
///
///
/// ## Bounding
///
/// * The capability bounding set is a mechanism that can be used to limit the capabilities that are gained during `execve()`.
/// * Before Linux 2.6.25, this was a system-wide and not thread-specific set.
///
///
/// ## Ambient
///
/// * This is a set of capabilities that are preserved across an `execve()` of a program *unless* it `execve()`s a program with either:-
///		* file capabilities set
/// 	* setuid/setgid bits set.
/// * In which case the new capabilities are applied.
/// * No capability can never be ambient if it is not both:-
///		* `Permitted`
///		* `Inheritable`.
/// * A capability is automatically removed this set if it is removed:-
/// 	* `Permitted`
/// 	* `Inheritable`
