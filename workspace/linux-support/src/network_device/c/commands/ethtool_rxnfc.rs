	/// For `ETHTOOL_GRXFH` and `ETHTOOL_SRXFH`, a bit mask indicating the fields included in the flow hash, eg `RXH_IP_SRC`.
	/// In this case, `fs`, `rule_count_or_rss_context` and `rule_locs` must not be used unless `flow_type` includes `FLOW_RSS`, in which case `rule_count_or_rss_context.rss_context` determines the RSS context to act on.
	///
	/// For `ETHTOOL_GRXRINGS`, the number of receive ring queues on return.
	///
	/// For `ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLCNT`, if non-zero on return, then it is the size of the rule table or-ed with the flag `RX_CLS_LOC_SPECIAL` if the driver supports any special location values. If `RX_CLS_LOC_SPECIAL` is not set then the driver does not support special location values.

	/// * `rule_count_or_rss_context.rss_context` contains the context associated with the rule if `fs.flow_type` includes the `FLOW_RSS` flag.
	///
	/// For `ETHTOOL_SRXCLSRLINS`, `fs` specifies the rule to add or update.
	/// On entry, `fs.location` either specifies the location to use or is a special location value (the `RX_CLS_LOC_SPECIAL` flag is set).
	/// On return, `fs.location` is the actual rule location.
	/// If `fs.flow_type` includes the `FLOW_RSS` flag, `rule_count_or_rss_context.rss_context` is the rule's context.
	/// "The value from the rxfh indirection table will be added to `fs.ring_cookie` to choose which ring to deliver to".
	///
	/// For `ETHTOOL_SRXCLSRLDEL`, `fs.location` specifies the location of an exist rule on entry.
