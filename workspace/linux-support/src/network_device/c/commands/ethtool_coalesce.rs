/// Coalescing parameters for IRQs and statistics updates.
///
/// Each pair of (usecs, max_frames) fields specifies that interrupts should be coalesced until `(usecs > 0 && time_since_first_completion >= usecs) || (max_frames > 0 && completed_frames >= max_frames)`.
///
/// It is illegal to set both usecs and max_frames to zero as this would cause interrupts to never be generated.
/// To disable coalescing, set `usecs = 0` and `max_frames = 1`.
///
/// Some implementations ignore the value of `max_frames` and use the condition `time_since_first_completion >= usecs`.
/// This is deprecated.  Drivers for hardware that does not support counting completions should validate that `max_frames == !rx_usecs`.
///
/// Adaptive receive coalescing and transmit coalescing is an algorithm implemented by some drivers to improve latency under low packet rates and improve throughput under high packet rates.
/// Some drivers only implement one of receive or transmit adaptive coalescing.
/// Anything not implemented by the driver causes these values to be silently ignored.
///
/// When the packet rate is below `pkt_rate_high` but above `pkt_rate_low` (both measured in packets per second) the normal `{rx,tx}_*` coalescing parameters are used.
