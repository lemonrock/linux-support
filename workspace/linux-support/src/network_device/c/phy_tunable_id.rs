	///
	/// For RX, only a minimal link-detection is available, and for TX the PHY wakes up to send link pulses to avoid any lock-ups in case the peer PHY may also be running in EDPD mode.
	///
	/// Some PHYs may support configuration of the wake-up interval for TX pulses, and some PHYs may support only disabling TX pulses entirely.
	/// For the latter a special value is required (`ETHTOOL_PHY_EDPD_NO_TX`) so that this can be configured from userspace (should the user want it).
	///
	/// The interval units for TX wake-up are in milliseconds, since this should cover a reasonable range of intervals:-
	///
	/// * from 1 millisecond, which does not sound like much of a power-saver;
	/// * to circa 65 seconds which is quite a lot to wait for a link to come up when plugging a cable in.
