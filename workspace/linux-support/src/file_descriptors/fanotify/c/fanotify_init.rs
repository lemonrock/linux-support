{
	/// `fanotify_init()` initializes a new fanotify group and returns a file descriptor for the event queue associated with the group.
	///
	/// The file descriptor is used in calls to `fanotify_mark()` to specify the files, directories, and mounts for which fanotify events shall be created.
	/// These events are received by reading from the file descriptor.
	/// Some events are only informative, indicating that a file has been accessed.
	/// Other events can be used to determine whether another application is permitted to access a file or directory. Permission to access filesystem objects is granted by writing to the file descriptor.
	///
	/// Multiple programs may be using the fanotify interface at the same time to monitor the same files.
	///
	/// In the current implementation, the number of fanotify groups per user is limited to `128`.
	/// This limit cannot be overridden.
	///
	/// Calling `fanotify_init()` requires the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.
	/// This constraint might be relaxed in future versions of the API.
	/// Therefore, certain additional capability checks have been implemented.
	///
	/// The `flags` argument contains a multi-bit field defining the notification class of the listening application and further single bit fields specifying the behavior of the file descriptor.
	///
	/// If multiple listeners for permission events exist, the notification class is used to establish the sequence in which the listeners receive the events.
	/// The order of notification for listeners in the same notification class is undefined.
	///
	/// Listeners with different notification classes will receive events in the order `FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT`, `FAN_CLASS_CONTENT` and `FAN_CLASS_NOTIF`.
	///
	/// The `event_f_flags` argument defines the file status flags that will be set on the open file descriptions that are created for fanotify events.
	/// For details of these flags, see the description of the flags values in `man 2 open`.
	/// `event_f_flags` includes a multi-bit field for the access mode combined from `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`, `O_LARGEFILE`, `O_CLOEXEC`, `O_APPEND`, `O_DSYNC`, `O_NOATIME`, `O_NONBLOCK` and `O_SYNC`.
	///
	/// On success, `fanotify_init()` returns a new file descriptor.
	/// On error, `-1` is returned, and `errno` is set to indicate the error.
	///
	/// Errors documented to be returned from `fanotify_init()` in `errno`:-
	///
	/// * `EINVAL`: An invalid value was passed in `flags` or `event_f_flags`. `FAN_ALL_INIT_FLAGS` defines all allowable bits for `flags`.
	/// * `EMFILE`: The number of fanotify groups for this user exceeds 128.
	/// * `EMFILE`: The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.
	/// * `ENOMEM`: The allocation of memory for the notification group failed.
	/// * `ENOSYS`: This kernel does not implement `fanotify_init()`. The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was configured with `CONFIG_FANOTIFY`.
	/// * `EPERM`: The operation is not permitted because the caller lacks the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.
