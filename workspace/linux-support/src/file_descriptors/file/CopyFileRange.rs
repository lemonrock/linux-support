/// Fast logic that avoids memory copies inside the Linux kernel to copy from one file to another.
///
/// Use this trait in conjunction with `Sparseness` to efficiently copy files from one location to another (by finding out where there are zero-byte holes, and so not copying them).
///
/// If the underlying file system supports Copy-on-Write, see the `CopyOnWrite` trait for more efficient copying still.

{
	/// Panics if `from_offset + length` exceeds `usize::MAX`.
	/// Panics if `to_offset + length` exceeds `usize::MAX`.
	/// Panics if `from` and `to` refer to the same file and `from_offset + length` overlaps with `to_offset + length`.
	///
	/// `from_offset`, if `None`, causes reads to start from the current (seek) position in the file read from (`self`).
	/// After a copy, the seek position of `self` will have changed by the numbers of bytes `Ok(number of bytes copied)`.
	///
	/// `from_offset`, if `Some(offset)`, causes reads to start from the position in the file read from `offset`.
	/// It will be updated by `Ok(number of bytes copied)` after a copy, but the file read from 's current (seek) position will be unchanged.
	///
	/// `to_offset`, if `None`, causes writes to start from the current (seek) position in the file written `to`.
	/// After a copy, the seek position of `self` will have changed by the numbers of bytes `Ok(number of bytes copied)`.
	///
	/// `to_offset`, if `Some(offset)`, causes writes to start from the position in the file written to `offset`.
	/// It will be updated by `Ok(number of bytes copied)` after a copy, but the file written to 's current (seek) position will be unchanged.
	///
	/// Returns `Ok(number of bytes copied)` on success.
	/// `Err(true)` if a non-permanent failure (out of kernel memory, low-level IO failure) occurred.
	/// `Err(false)` if a permanent failure (out of disk space, and, before Linux 5.3, files are on different filesystems) occurred.
