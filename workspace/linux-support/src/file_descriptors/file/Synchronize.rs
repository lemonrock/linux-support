pub trait Synchronize: AsRawFd + Seek + FileExt
{
	/// This function permits fine control when synchronizing the open file referred to by the file with disk.
	///
	/// `offset` is the starting byte of the file range to be synchronized.
	///
	/// `number_of_bytes` specifies the length of the range to be synchronized, in bytes; if `number_of_bytes` is zero, then all bytes from offset through to the end of file are synchronized.
	/// Synchronization is in units of the system page size: offset is rounded down to a page boundary; `offset + number_of_bytes - 1` is rounded up to a page boundary.
	///
	/// If `synchronize_file_range_flags` is empty, then nothing happens but a system call is wasted.
	///
	///
	/// # Warning
	///
	/// This system call is extremely dangerous.
	/// None of these operations writes out the file's metadata.
	/// Therefore, unless the application is strictly performing overwrites of already-instantiated disk blocks, there are no guarantees that the data will be available after a crash.
	/// There is no user interface to know if a write is purely an overwrite.
	/// On file systems using copy-on-write semantics (eg, btrfs) an overwrite of existing allocated blocks is impossible.
	/// When writing into preallocated space, many file systems also require calls into the block allocator, which this system call does not sync out to disk.
	/// This system call does not flush disk write caches and thus does not provide any data integrity on systems with volatile disk write caches.
	///
	/// Returns `Ok(())` on success.
	/// Returns `Err(true)` if a recoverable error was present (I/O failed, out of disk space).
	/// Returns `Err(false)` if the kernel was out of memory
