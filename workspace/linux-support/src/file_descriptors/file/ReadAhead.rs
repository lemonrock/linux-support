/// Read ahead optimization.
pub trait ReadAhead: AsRawFd + Seek + FileExt
{
	/// This function populates the page cache with data from a file so that subsequent reads from that file will not block on disk I/O.
	///
	/// The `offset` argument specifies the starting point from which data is to be read and count specifies the number of bytes to be read.
	/// I/O is performed in whole pages, so that `offset` is effectively rounded down to a page boundary and bytes are read up to the next page boundary greater than or equal to `offset + count`).
	///
	/// Reading does not read beyond the end of the file.
	/// This function blocks until the specified data has been read.
	///
	/// The current file offset (position) of the open file is left unchanged.
	///
	/// Returns an error if the file does not support reading ahead.
	/// Panics if the file is not open for reading.
