/// Advisory per-process file record locks.
///
/// These are POSIX file record locks.
///
/// Locks are associated with a process.
/// Locks are automatically released when a process terminates.
/// Locks are not inherited by a child created via `fork()`, but are preserved across an `execve()`.
///
/// This uses a lower-level wrapper than `lockf()` but uses the same underlying functionality.
///
/// Locks obtained this way are compatible with locks obtained by other processes using `lockf()`.
///
/// A record lock is also known as a:-
///
/// * byte-range lock
/// * file-segment lock
/// * file-region lock
///
/// There are some important caveats, which are avoid if using `OpenFileDescriptionAdvisoryFileRecordLocking` instead:-
///
/// * If a process closes *any* file descriptor referring to a file, then all of the process's locks on that file are released, regardless  of the file descriptor(s) on which the locks were obtained. This is *bad*: it means that a process can lose its locks on a file such as `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/mtab` when for some reason a library function decides to open, read, and close the same file.
/// *  The threads in a process share locks. In other words, a multithreaded program can't use record locking to ensure that threads don't simultaneously access the same region of a file.
