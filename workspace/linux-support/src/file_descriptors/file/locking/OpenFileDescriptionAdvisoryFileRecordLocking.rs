/// Advisory open file description file record locks.
///
/// Since Linux 3.15.
///
/// These are *not* POSIX file record locks.
///
/// Locks are associated with a file description.
/// Locks are automatically released when all file descriptors for a file description are closed; so duplicated file descriptors also preserve lock ownership.
/// Locks are inherited by children with `fork()` and `clone()`.
///
/// Locks obtained this way are *NOT* compatible with locks obtained by other processes using `lockf()`.
///
/// A record lock is also known as a:-
///
/// * byte-range lock
/// * file-segment lock
/// * file-region lock
