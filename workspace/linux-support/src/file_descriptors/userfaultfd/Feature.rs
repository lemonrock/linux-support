	///
	/// There are two ways to use this feature:-
	///
	/// 1. by adding `SupportEventsOnHugetlbfs` to the `uffdio_api.features` before calling `UFFDIO_API`, an error will be returned by `UFFDIO_API` on a kernel without hugetlbfs support.
	/// 2. the `SupportEventsOnHugetlbfs` can not be added in `uffdio_api.features` and instead it will be set by the kernel in the `uffdio_api.features` if the kernel supports it, so userland can later check if the feature flag is present in `uffdio_api.features` after `UFFDIO_API` succeeded".
