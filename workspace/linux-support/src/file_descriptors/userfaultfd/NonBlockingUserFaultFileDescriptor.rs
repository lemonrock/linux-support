	/// Poll and read events.
	///
	/// __NOTE__: If used to monitor a process which contains the thread executing `poll_and_read_events()` then it is possible to enter a deadlock-akin situation:-
	///
	/// 1. A thread on the monitored processes requests termination by calling `Terminate::begin_termination()`.
	/// 2. The same thread, or another, tries to read or write to memory which causes a user land page-fault event notification that this thread, executing `poll_and_read_events()`, should handle.
	/// 3. The thread in (2) above is blocked (suspended) until the page fault is resolved (ie `copy_registered_memory_subrange(wake_up_suspended_thread_that_page_faulted_in_registered_memory_subrange = true)`, `zero_registered_memory_subrange(wake_up_suspended_thread_that_page_faulted_in_registered_memory_subrange = true)` or `wake_up_suspended_thread_that_page_faulted_in_registered_memory_subrange()` in `UserFaultFileDescriptor` has not be called).
	/// 4. However, `poll_and_read_events()` returns because `Terminate::should_continue()` is now false, and it never reads the page fault notification event.
	/// 5. Deadlock. The thread in (2) is suspended forever.
