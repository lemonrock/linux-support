	/// `shutdown()` is most useful for initiating TCP 's `FIN` state machine, and so freeing up resources inside Linux.
	///
	/// There is very little advantages in half-close, especially when sockets are used with upper layer protocols such as TLS, as these can do reads when a logical write is required, and vice-versa.
	///
	/// `how` is one of `SHUT_RD` (shutdown read), `SHUT_WR` (shutdown write) or `SHUT_RDWR` (shutdown read and write).
	///
	/// On success, zero is returned.
	/// On error, `-1` is returned, and `errno` is set appropriately.
	///
	/// The known errors that can be set in `errno` are:-
	///
	/// * `EBADF`: `sockfd` is not a valid file descriptor.
	/// * `EINVAL`: An invalid value was specified in `how`.
	/// * `ENOTCONN`: The specified socket is not connected.
	/// * `ENOTSOCK`: The file descriptor `sockfd` does not refer to a socket.
