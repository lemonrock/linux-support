	/// The clock `clockid` is one of the constants `CLOCK_REALTIME`, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`, `CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM` or `CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM`.
	///
	/// The current value of the clock `clockid` can be retrieved using `clock_gettime()`.
	///
	/// `flags` is either zero or a bitwise or of the constants starting `TFD_*`.
	///
	/// On success,` timerfd_create()` returns a new file descriptor (it is not known if this can be negative).
	/// On error, `-1` is returned and `errno` is set to indicate the error.
	///
	/// The known errors that can be set in `errno` are:-
	///
	/// * `EINVAL`: The `clockid` argument is neither `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` nor `CLOCK_REALTIME` (?conflicts with earlier documentation)?
	/// * `EINVAL`: `flags` is invalid; or, in Linux 2.6.26 or earlier, `flags` is nonzero.
	/// * `EMFILE`: The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.
	/// * `ENFILE`: The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
	/// * `ENODEV`: Could not mount (internal) anonymous inode device.
	/// * `ENOMEM`: There was insufficient kernel memory to create the timer.
