/// These are the io priority groups as implemented by the Completely Fair Queueing (CFQ) scheduler:-
///
/// * RT is the realtime class, it always gets premium service. Trumps BE.
/// * BE is the best-effort scheduling class, the default for any process. Trumps IDLE.
/// * IDLE is the idle scheduling class, it is only served when no one else is using the disk.
///
/// There are a maximum of 8 priority classes in the top 3 bits of the `ioprio`.
