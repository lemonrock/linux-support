# linux-support

[linux-support] is a Rust crate for comprehensive Linux support for namespaces, cgroups, processes, scheduling, parsing a vast number of files in `/proc` and `/sys`, signals, hyper threads, CPUS, NUMA nodes, io-uring, io scheduling priority, unusual file descriptors (including pid descriptors and userfaultfd), seccomp BPF filters (including a Rust abstraction), PCI devices, atomic file renames, and much, much more.

It is intended to be a holistic, very strongly typed and properly modelled library for working with Linux's non-POSIX features, with a particular focus on being a support library for a secure root daemon running a userspace networking stack that I'm developing. As a result, it's highly opinionated; it happily makes use of unsafe code, nightly features and `uninitialized()`.

File descriptors, process and vectored-io are tightly integrated.

It replaces several C and Rust libraries including:-

* From C, the horrid and effectively legacy libraries:-
    * `libnuma`.
    * `libhugetlbfs`.
    * `libcpuset` (planned).
* From Rust:-
    * [cpu-affinity](https://crates.io/crates/cpu-affinity).
    * [dpdk-unix](https://crates.io/crates/dpdk-unix).
    * [file-descriptors](https://github.com/lemonrock/file-descriptors).
    * [fs2](https://github.com/danburkert/fs2-rs).
        * Adding support for 3 kinds of file locks available since Linux 3.1.
    * [libc-extra](https://crates.io/crates/libc-extra) (partly).
    * [linux-personality](https://crates.io/crates/linux-personality).
    * [iovec](https://crates.io/crates/iovec).
    * [memfd](https://crates.io/crates/memfd).
    * [num_cpus](https://crates.io/crates/num_cpus).
    * [process_vm_io](https://crates.io/crates/process_vm_io).
    * [term-handler](https://crates.io/crates/term-handler).
    * [vm-info](https://crates.io/crates/vm-info).

It is not intended to replace [nix](https://crates.io/crates/nix), but as an alternative for Linux-specific applications.

	* Init groups
	* Checks for root where necessary with documented assertions.
* Vectors
    * Proper vector IO, including for File.
    * Integrates Vector I/O for process memory.

Currently only Linux using the musl libc has been tested, but support should be possible with minor changes for Android, Fuschia and Emscripten.

The primary architecture of the crate is 64-bit systems, with x86-64 a first tier architecture. Support is then secondary for aarch64 and riscv64 and 'best efforts' for powerpc64, mips64 and sparc64.

No support is planned for any 32-bit system.

It uses nightly because Rust still hasn't stabilized important features after 4 years.


## File Descriptors module

This is a Rust module wrapping the various kinds of file descriptors with safe abstractions, including IPv4 / IPv6 sockets, Unix domain sockets, epoll, timerfd, signalfd, eventfd, POSIX message queues, pipes, FIFOs, terminals (and serial ports), character devices, inotify, fanotify and Files.

There is a particularly extensive and safe wrapper for signals and terminals.


### Supported File Descriptors

* character devices.
* directory
    * creating FIFOs, unix domain sockets, character devices and block devices.
* epoll.
* eventfd.
* fanotify.
* file extensions for
    * posix and non-posix allocate
    * file leases
    * advisory whole file locks
    * advisory per-process file record locks
    * advisory open file description file record locks
    * synchronizing file ranges
    * copying file ranges
    * synchronizing data only
    * synchronizing filesystems
    * read ahead
* inotify.
* memfd (anonymous memory backed files).
    * See `file` module.
* POSIX message queues (<https://linux.die.net/man/7/mq_overview>).
* pipes and FIFOs (anonymous and named FIFOs), including support for splice, vmsplice and tee.
* Process File Descriptors (pidfd, new in Linux 5.2).
* sockets (TCP, UDP and the equivalent over Unix Domain Sockets; `sendfile()` with Rust's `std::file::File` supported).
* terminals (serial ports and modems).
* timerfd.
* Extensions for `std::fs::File`:-
    * `SendFile`
    * `SpliceRecipient`
    * `SpliceSender`
    * `memfd`
        * Memory mapping files.

Additionally, extensions (`SendFile`, `SpliceRecipient` and `SpliceSender`) are implemented for Rust's `File`.


### Unix Domain Sockets


#### When using file paths

* Every effort is made to create the socket file path cleanly;
* To make sure all parent folders exist;
* To make sure parent folder permissions are correctly set;
* To remove any stale files;
* To remove socket file paths on drop (close).

The above features may not work correctly after the use of `seccomp` to lock down system calls (particularly the attempt to delete a socket file path on close).


### Pipes

* The use of `splice()`, `vmsplice()` and `tee()` are supported for all file descriptors where possible (including Rust's `std::fs::File`).
* To be able to use epoll with standard in (`stdin`), use `pipes_and_fifos::ReceivePipeFileDescriptor::standard_in()`.
* To be able to use epoll with standard out (`stdout`), use `pipes_and_fifos::SendPipeFileDescriptor::standard_out()`.
* To be able to use epoll with standard error (`stderr`), use `pipes_and_fifos::SendPipeFileDescriptor::standard_error()`.


### Unsupported for now

* Linux zero copy send (`MSG_ZEROCOPY`) and receive (`SO_ZEROCOPY`), mostly because they have a horrible, hacky API.
* Unix Domain Sockets using `autobind`; setting of the `SO_PASSCRED` socket option.
* Receiving credentials over Unix Domain Sockets using `recvmsg()`.
* infiniband sockets.
* canbus (SocketCAN sockets and can4linux <http://can-wiki.info/can4linux/man/can4linux_8h_source.html> character device drivers).
